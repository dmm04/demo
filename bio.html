    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size:15px">Hello! my name is Dylan Michael McDade, I was born and raised in 
        West Virginia, and I live in Monroe County. During my early years, I attended Mountain View
        Elementary and Middle School, and eventually moved on to James Monroe High School, 
        Where I developed my passion for writing. I always had loved reading, but high school influenced me to
        try my hand at creating a world of my own, and I quickly fell in love. After high school, I decided
        that I wasn't done learning and that I should attend college <abbr title="As soon as possible!">ASAP!</abbr> 
        I then moved on to concord university where i currently study! My personal information is listed below.
